  We were at the school premises yesterday, 26th May 2005 — the Excos, the planning committees, and the honorable members — to present our project, **"10 Pieces of Trash Bin"** to the school administration. This initiative is part of our contributions to the forthcoming *MOSCOSA Day* event.

  I want to use this medium to appreciate everyone in attendance yesterday. You created time out of no time to represent us — I am so grateful.

  I pray that every individual who supports this noble cause, God will replenish them in multiple.

  And for those who wish to support or are still planning to do so, may God make it easier for them and bless them beyond expectations.
