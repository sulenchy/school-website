          <p className="text-gray-700 text-justify mb-5">
          The history of Moslem Comprehensive High School dates back to 1955 with the establishment of two schools: Moslem Boys Modern School, Isoku, and Moslem Girls Secondary School, Imepe. In 1965, the Muslim community decided to merge these two schools to enhance efficiency and performance. This amalgamation resulted in the formation of Moslem Secondary Commercial School, Imepe, which initially had a total population of 126 pupils—60 boys and 66 girls.
          </p>

          <p className="text-gray-700 text-justify">
The school maintained its commercial status until 1980, when the late Chief Olabisi Onabanjo’s civilian administration upgraded it to a full-fledged secondary institution. This upgrade gave the school its present name, Moslem Comprehensive High School, Imepe, Ijebu-Ode. Despite the changes, the school retains February 1, 1955, as its year of establishment.</p>
